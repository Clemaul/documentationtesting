= Documentation testing

Instead of writing tests, we just writing documentation from the code.

We can execute code and format output to show what is the context, the action and result.

When documentation change, test fails.

We have to check the new behaviour describe in documentation is the right one and, if it is, approved documentation.
The fact of approving documentation meaning the specification is write.

The advantage is that we not have to check in tests the expected result.
If the result we see in documentation is right, that's ok.
The second advantage is that we focus on documentation so that all our tests are readable by every one.

The main goal is when we change a configuration, we do not have to change tests.
We just see difference in documentation and approved it or not.
